Having worked as a nurse in Sierra Leone and abroad Cole was shocked by the differences in medical care and education between comparable countries.\u00a0In particular, she dislikes the disparity in services available to the rich and poor and the high rate of deaths from preventable or treatable illnesses. She is also disappointed in the high maternal death rate.\n\nCole considered joining a political party in 2013, but could not find one that she agreed with. In 2016 she decided to found her own party \u2013 the Unity Party.\u00a0 Cole had to wait until October 2017 before the party was registered but began campaigning ahead of that. The party\u0027s main focus is education and health but Cole also wants to create new jobs and improve trade links.\u00a0Cole and her campaign team offer free health checks for \u0022vulnerable

Democratic Change (PMDC)","ElectionYear":"2018","ElectionType":"Presidential","Profile":"Charles Francis Kondo Margai (born 19 August 1945[1]) is a Sierra Leonean lawyer and politician. He is the leader of the People\u0027s Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC), the third major political party in Sierra Leone, after the big two, the Sierra Leone People\u0027s Party (SLPP) and the All People\u0027s Congress (APC). He was his party\u0027s candidate in the August 2007 presidential election, placing third with 10% of the vote.\u00a0He is the son of former Sierra Leone\u0027s Prime Minister Albert Margai and the nephew of Sierra Leone\u0027s first Prime Minister Milton Margai.\n\nMargai began working as a lawyer in 1971 as State Counsel in Freetown. He later opened his private law office in 1973 in Bo.\n\nMargai was a member of the Sierra Leone People\u0027s Party (SLPP), which was co-founded in 1951 by his uncle Milton Margai. Both his father and his uncle had been leaders of the SLPP. In 1996 Charles Margai sought the nomination to stand as the party\u0027s candidate in the 1996 presidential elections. When he failed to secure the nomination he left the SLPP\n\nIn the aftermath of Margai\u0027s failure to become the SLPP presidential candidate, he joined the National Unity Party and ran in the 1996 parliamentary election\n\nHe subsequently returned to the SLPP and in April 1998, Margai became Minister of Internal Affairs and Local Government following the restoration of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah;[5][6] From November 1999 he was Minister of Safety and Security.\n\nOn 6 January 2002, Kabbah requested that Margai clarify reports that the latter planned to seek the SLPP party leadership, which was held by Kabbah. Margai resigned as a minister on 8 January 2002 following a meeting with Kabbah, in which Kabbah expressed concern that the country might appear unstable and might therefore receive less aid from abroad.\n\nOn 9 January, Margai confirmed his plans to seek the leadership of the SLPP and its presidential nomination, describing himself as the best person for the position and saying that he had resigned from the cabinet \u0022in the interest of good governance and for the people of this nation\u0022 due to \u0022mistrust\u0022 between himself and Kabbah.[8]\n\nOn 8 March, however, the High Court ruled that he was not technically a member of the SLPP, preventing him from seeking the nomination, which was won by Kabbah.[4]\n\nMargai was President of the Sierra Leone Bar Association from 2004 to 2005.[1]\n\nMargai again unsuccessfully sought the SLPP presidential nomination at the party\u0027s national convention in Makeni on 3\u20134 September 2005; he received second place, with 34 votes, far behind Vice-President Solomon Berewa, who received 291 votes.\n\nIn early October 2005, he broke with the SLPP to form a new party, the People\u0027s Movement for Democratic Change. Margai faced difficulty in getting the PMDC officially registered, which he alleged was due to Kabbah deliberately delaying appointments to the Political Parties Commission which would enable the registration, thereby giving Berewa\u0027s campaign an advantage in time.\n\nThe PMDC was officially registered on 19 January 2006.","CandidatePhoto":"charles-francis-margai.jpg"},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"1675","Prefix":"","FirstName":"Christopha","MiddleName":"","SurName":"Margai","Suffix":"","PoliticalParty":"","ElectionYear":"","ElectionType":"","Profile":"","CandidatePhoto":""},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"23618","Prefix":"","FirstName":"Edward","MiddleName":"Murray","SurName":"Margao","Suffix":"","PoliticalParty":"All

April 7, 1962) is a Sierra Leonean politician who was the Vice President of Sierra Leone from September 17, 2007 to March 17, 2015. Sam-Sumana stood as the vice-presidential candidate of the All People\u0027s Congress (APC) in the 2007 presidential election, alongside presidential candidate Ernest Bai Koroma. The APC ticket defeated the Sierra Leone People\u0027s Party (SLPP) presidential candidate Solomon Berewa and vice presidential candidate Momodou Koroma. Sam-Sumana took office as Vice President on September 17, 2007.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn March 17, 2015, President Koroma sacked Sam-Sumana as Vice President on the grounds that he had abandoned his position and sought asylum in the United States Embassy in Freetown, and for not belonging to a political party [2][3][4][5] although it was reported by several local and international media that Sam-Sumana fled his residence fearing for his life, before soldiers had surrounded his house and disarmed his security team. The Sierra Leone government said Sam-Sumana was not in any danger and that soldiers only came to Sam-Sumana\u0027s house to rotate his security team [6]. President Ernest Bai Koroma sacked Sam-Sumana for also not belonging to a political party, though he was expelled from the APC party by the National Advisory Council of the All People\u0027s Congress on March 6, 2015. Sam-Sumana said his sacking by president Ernest Bai Koroma was unconstitutional and has appealed to the Sierra Leone Supreme Court.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sacking of Sam-Sumana was described as unconstitutional by the main opposition Sierra Leone People\u0027s Party (SLPP), the Sierra Leone Labour Congress, which represent the country\u0027s trade union, and by the Sierra Leone Bar Association, which is made up of many of the country\u0027s lawyers.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe APC National Advisory Council expelled Sam-Sumana on accusations of Sam-Sumana allegedly giving false information about his Master\u0027s degree certificate; he was accused of allegedly instigating political violence in Kono District; was accused of allegedly trying to form a breakaway faction of a new political party; and was also accused of allegedly giving false information about his religion. Sam-Sumana denied all the allegations against him and has appealed his sacking as vice president. Sam-Sumana denied all the allegations against him; and described them as completely wrong and baseless .\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESam-Sumana served as the managing director of the United Diamond Mining Company based in Koidu Town, Kono District, Sierra Leone. He also served as the regional manager for C-12 International, a Texas based mining company engaged in diamond production in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESam-Sumana is a devout Muslim and a member of the Kono ethnic group.[6] Sam-Sumana is married to Khadija Sam-Sumana. The couple resided in Minnesota in the United States, but returned to Freetown in 2007 when Sam-Sumana was named as running mate by opposition leader Ernest Bai Koroma on the ticket of the All People\u0027s Congress (APC).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESam Sumana is now the Leader and flag bearer of the Coalition For Change or C4C, a progressive Political party in Sierra Leone.

1905 \u2013 29 May 1988) was the leader of Sierra Leone from 1967 to 1985, serving as Prime Minister from 1967 to 1971 and as President from 1971 to 1985. Stevens\u0027 leadership was often characterised by patrimonial rule and self worship, consolidating power by means of corruption and exploitation.[1]\n\nStevens and his All People\u0027s Congress (APC) party won the closely contested 1967 Sierra Leone general elections over incumbent Prime Minister Sir Albert Margai of the Sierra Leone People\u0027s Party (SLPP). In April 1971, Stevens made Sierra Leone a republic and became president a day after the constitution had been ratified by the Parliament of Sierra Leone. He was the second President of the Republic after Christopher Okoro Cole, a judge, who was sworn in for a day after which he resigned, paving the way for Stevens.\n\nStevens served as Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) from 1 July 1980 to 24 June 1981 and engineered the creation of the Mano River Union, a three-country economic federation of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.\n\nStevens retired from office at the end of his term on 28 November 1985. After pressuring all other potential successors to step aside, he chose Major-General Joseph Saidu Momoh, the commander of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces, as his successor.","CandidatePhoto":"siaka_stevens.jpg"},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"7566","Prefix":"","FirstName":"Idrissa","MiddleName":"","SurName":"Suma","Suffix":"","PoliticalParty":"Independent (I)","ElectionYear":"2018","ElectionType":"Village Headmen","Profile":"","CandidatePhoto":""},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"23590","Prefix":"","FirstName":"Foday","MiddleName":"Ishaga","SurName":"Suma","Suffix":"","PoliticalParty":"All Peoples Congress (APC)","ElectionYear":"2018","ElectionType":"Parliamentary","Profile":"","CandidatePhoto":"male-blank-profile-photo.png"},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"1426","Prefix":"","FirstName":"Alusine","MiddleName":"","SurName":"Sumah","Suffix":"","PoliticalParty":"","ElectionYear":"","ElectionType":"","Profile":"","CandidatePhoto":""},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"1289","Prefix":"Dr.","FirstName":"Foday","MiddleName":"","SurName":"Sumah","Suffix":"","PoliticalParty":"","ElectionYear":"","ElectionType":"","Profile":"","CandidatePhoto":""},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"2761","Prefix":"Mr.","FirstName":"Abraham K","MiddleName":"","SurName":"Sumah","Suffix":"","PoliticalParty":"Peoples Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC)","ElectionYear":"2007","ElectionType":"Parliamentary","Profile":"","CandidatePhoto":""},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"2482","Prefix":"Ms.","FirstName":"Theresa","MiddleName":"","SurName":"SUWU","Suffix":"","PoliticalParty":"Citizens Democratic Party (CDP)","ElectionYear":"2007","ElectionType":"Parliamentary","Profile":"","CandidatePhoto":""},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"5254","Prefix":"Mr.","FirstName":"Rev.

He has served in both the ruling APC and the main opposition SLPP in different capacities. He is, however, contesting on the ticket of the Citizens Democratic Party (CDP).\n\nHe was duly nominated after a party congress in January this year. He is a one-time youth leader of the SLPP and served as a minister under the APC government. He held positions of Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Lands at a point.\n\nHe is on record to have stated that his love for politics started in his teens adding that he was running for the presidency because of his love for Sierra Leone.\n\nHe was sacked as Minister of Lands by President Koroma in 2015 over shady deals under his tenure. Bangura Paul Alimamy will be standing as vice president for the CDP.\n\nThe authorities detained him in December 2016 over the issue, a move he described as politically motivated given that it coincided with his declaration to run for president","CandidatePhoto":"musa-tarawally.jpg"},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"3032","Prefix":"Mr.","FirstName":"Kenneth
