Ernest Bai Koroma is the eldest son of eight children. He attended the Sierra Leone Church Primary School, Government Secondary School, Magburaka (Boys School) and Fourah Bay College (FBC), University of Sierra Leone.

The supporters of the APC found in Ernest Bai Koroma a leader who would combine his entrepreneurial skills and public spiritedness to carve a new path for development, private sector led growth and commitment to leaving no citizen behind in the country\u2019s transformation into a peaceful, democratic and properly developing society.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 2002 Presidential elections were a turning point in the political career of President Ernest Bai Koroma. Despite losing the Presidential elections, he increased the number of seats of the APC in the Sierra Leone Parliament from a paltry five to twenty-seven seats in the 2002 General Elections.\u00a0\u00a0He became the Minority Leader in Parliament from 2002 to 2007. His transformative leadership qualities, commitment to country, dignity and integrity gained increased visibility during this period and endeared him to a majority of his compatriots.
